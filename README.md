# App Walkthrough

When initially opening the app and when the search bar is empty, you will see the most trending gifs around the world.

When you get to the bottom of the page, a little button pops up in case you want to jump back to the top. There is also a pagination with hundreds of pages in order to explore as many gifs as possible in the smoothest possible way.
